   Tuple : Just like a list, a tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between a tuple 
           and a list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created.They are defined using parentheses `( )`.

   Set : A Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
         They are defined using curly braces `{ }`.
