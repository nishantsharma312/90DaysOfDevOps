# Tasks Day 04 :- 
 1. Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
    
    To save yourself from making disasters and save your precious time. If you need to do certain jobs repetitively, 
    create a script to simplify your jobs, this way it will be harder for you to accidentally make a mess. 
    First you create a script and then you automate it. Therefore Learning shell script is a worthy investment.
 
 2. What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
    
    _#!/bin/bash_
    
    The most common shebang is the one referring to the bash executable:
    Essentially it tells your terminal that when you run the script it should use bash to execute it. 
    It can be vital since you may be using a different shell in your machine (zsh, fish, sh, etc.), but 
    you designed the script to work specifically with bash. In many cases, it doesn’t matter what shell you’re using,
    but there can be some very noteworthy differences in how they work, leading a script to work in bash but not sh .
    
    For a long time, _/bin/sh
/bin/bash_ used to point to _/bin/sh
/bin/bash_ on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe 
    to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.
